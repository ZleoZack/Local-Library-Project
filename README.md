In one of the first projects we have created a fantastic catalogging software for our local Library to utilize the awesome skills we have learned as Software Developers.
Our local Library was faced with HUGE back loggs of papers and entries trying to sort everything was a MESS! Have no fear, the team from THINKFUL is here.
We made great use of our new ARRAY methods such as Filter, Find, Map, as well as returned values by defining new Objects, with Keys / Values utilizing Object.Keys/ Object.Entries
for our more advanced functions. We often tied together multiple array methods in this project to acheive our goals, such as filtering by Author, defining how our object 
would be structured, and then Mapping the information from one array to another. 

For our future reference this app is complete, but we could come back and implement REACT and ROUTING through multiple components to achieve maximum broswer efficiency, 
and take it to the next level with it's functionalilty. Maybe then taking it down the route of hosting it as an HTML page.
